## Project description
The goal of the project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. We’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.
This report will be considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

## Preprocess the data by steps:
-	Identify and fill in missing values
-	Replace the real number data type with the integer type
-	Delete duplicate data
-	Categorize the data

We'll make sure to explain:
-	Which missing values were identified
-	Possible reasons these missing values were present
-	Which method was used to fill in missing values
-	Which method was used to find and delete duplicate data and why
-	Possible reasons why duplicate data was present
-	Which method was used to change the data type and why
-	Which dictionaries 've been selected for this dataset and why


## Answer these questions of hypotheses:
-	Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?
-	Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?
-	Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?
-	How do different loan purposes affect on-time loan repayment?

## Description of the data:
-	children: the number of children in the family
-	days_employed: how long the customer has been working
-	dob_years: the customer’s age
-	education: the customer’s education level
